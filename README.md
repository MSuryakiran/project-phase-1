# project-phase-1
I have created my personal portfolio website using *HTML* and *CSS, focusing on implementing all the basic HTML elements. The site includes a structured **navigation bar* using the ⁠ <nav> ⁠ tag and organized content with *lists* (⁠ <ul> ⁠, ⁠ <ol> ⁠, ⁠ <li> ⁠), as well as a *table* to showcase structured information like skills or project details.

I’ve made use of various basic HTML tags such as:
•⁠  ⁠⁠ <p> ⁠ for paragraphs
•⁠  ⁠⁠ <a> ⁠ for hyperlinks
•⁠  ⁠⁠ <img> ⁠ for images
•⁠  ⁠⁠ <ins> ⁠ for inserted or highlighted text
•⁠  ⁠⁠ <br> ⁠, ⁠ <hr> ⁠, ⁠ <strong> ⁠, and others to ensure proper formatting and emphasis

The portfolio is styled using *CSS* to enhance its visual appearance and layout. This project helped me understand and apply the foundational building blocks of web development.
